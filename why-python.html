</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As I mentioned in my first blog post, I am going to write a short blog about one or two interesting thing I learned about data. Or, just a practical instruction on something I struggled to figure out and it might of help to others to know.
In the first week of the program, we delved into python programming focusing on working with pandas library. It is amazing to realize how powerful this tool is and how easy it makes to work with the data. I am sure that once you get the hold of the it you never go back to work with Excel! yes, I said this! Along with the matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization and statistical libraries such as sklrean you can do almost anything with data. Like many others, I previously depended on Excel or Matlab to work with data.
While Excel provides a user friendly visual interface, you are very limited on what you can do with data compare to pandas.
While Matlab is very powerful in terms of mathematical functionality, there are few drawbacks to it. First of all it is not free as opposed to  Pyhton or R which are open source. And, the advanced mathematical packages are not cheap! Furthermore, some manipulations that can be done in one line of code in python pandas, require several for loops in Matlab. 
As a final note, since R was developed by statisticians for the original purpose of working with data, it has very powerful statistical libraries and comparable capabilities in data manipulation with python. However, when it comes to programming language, python is definitely more powerful.
And, if you decide to try pandas, do not worry! There are abundant tutorials and examples on the web in addition to self explanatory python pages that are available for each method or function in python. And, you can find the answer to almost any question you have on stackoverflow or other python pages. 
Good Luck and enjoy python!</p>
